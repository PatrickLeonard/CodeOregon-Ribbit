## Synopsis

This app is my walk through of the "Ribbit" Treehouse Android application, a "destructible message app." This application is much like the "MemeMaker" app in that it allows users to use the camera to take photos (or use them from library), have and add friends and be able to send them the photos or messages. These messages are erased upon viewing by all users. The application uses the now defunct Parse.com for a backend. It needs to be updated with a new backend. Creating it was a great advanced lesson about the Android framework, hardware, database, camera capabilities, and networking capabilities.

## Motivation

Fun way to learn about Android application development with Android Studio as a part of Code Oregon 1.0, a state partnership between Oregon and Team Treehouse to teach programming skills to Oregon citizens.

## Installation

Recommend importing into Android Studio and doing some testing before deploying.
